The Riester-Payment-Calculator is a web-based Calculator for Riester-Pension-Insurances.

Citizens in Germany can invest in the **state-subsidised Riester-Pension**.

The target group of the Riester pension includes those who will be affected most by decreasing public pensions: compulsorily insured employees, agricultural workers and civil servants.

- households with low incomes
- households with many children (people will get additional subsidy for every child)

One of the main part to get the state-subsidiy is to pay **4-percent of your last year´s income before taxes**. There are a few more parts (in particular for some edge cases).

If you don´t pay the least amount to get te full subsidy, your subsidy will be reduced proportionally. In many cases the income changes over the years.

The idea behind the calculator is to give the user to ability to conveniently check if his payment is optimal.

Simply answer the questions and and get the final calculation. If necessary the user can save the calculation as a PDF.

## This calculator can´t and doesn´t want to replace the professional advice by an independant financial advisor!##
